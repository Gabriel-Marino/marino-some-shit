The Lorenz Attractor are the three following equations. They're teh basic example what caos can be. The minimum modification of the initial conditions lead to new results.

$
    \begin{aligned}
        & \frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma\cdot(y - x)         \\
        & \frac{dy}{dt} = x\cdot(\rho - z) - y       \\
        & \frac{dz}{dt} = y - \beta\cdot z           \\
    \end{aligned}
